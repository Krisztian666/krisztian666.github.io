Android 6.0 release removes support for the Apache HTTP client. 
If your app is using this client and targets Android 2.3 (API level 9) 
or higher, use the HttpURLConnection class instead. This API is more 
efficient because it reduces network use through transparent compression 
and response caching, and minimizes power consumption. 

But it is good to know how it works.
