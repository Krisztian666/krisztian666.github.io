Traditionally, there are two classes you can extend 
to create a started service:

- Service

This is the base class for all services. When you extend 
this class, it's important that you create a new thread in 
which to do all the service's work, because the service uses 
your application's main thread, by default, which could slow 
the performance of any activity your application is running.

- IntentService

This is a subclass of Service that uses a worker thread to handle 
all start requests, one at a time. This is the best option if you 
don't require that your service handle multiple requests simultaneously. 
All you need to do is implement onHandleIntent(), which receives the 
intent for each start request so you can do the background work.
