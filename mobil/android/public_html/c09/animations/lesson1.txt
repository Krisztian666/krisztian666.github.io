A bound service 

is one that allows application components to bind to it 
by calling bindService() in order to create a long-standing 
connection (and generally does not allow components to start 
it by calling startService()).

You should create a bound service when you want to interact with 
the service from activities and other components in your application 
or to expose some of your application's functionality to other 
applications, through interprocess communication (IPC).
