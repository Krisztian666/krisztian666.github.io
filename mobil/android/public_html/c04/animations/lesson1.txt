Notifications

A notification is a message you can display to the user 
outside of your application's normal UI. When you tell 
the system to issue a notification, it first appears as an 
icon in the notification area. To see the details of the 
notification, the user opens the notification drawer.


The example shows a notification, if 
About ToDo is called.
