Use of Service Component

A Service is an application component that can perform 
long-running operations in the background and does not 
provide a user interface. Another application component 
can start a service and it will continue to run in the 
background even if the user switches to another application.


A service can essentially take two forms:

- Started Service

A service is "started" when an application component 
(such as an activity) starts it by calling startService(). 
Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, 
even if the component that started it is destroyed. Usually, 
a started service performs a single operation and does not 
return a result to the caller. For example, it might download or 
upload a file over the network. When the operation is done, 
the service should stop itself.

- Bound
We will learn about it later.


First of all, extend the data handling of the ToDo application,
then add a Started Service. Android Studio can generate
a servie for you.
