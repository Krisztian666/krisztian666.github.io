Animations

Android supports more animation types. 

- Tweened animation

You can use the view animation system to perform tweened 
animation on Views. Tween animation calculates the animation 
with information such as the start point, end point, size, 
rotation, and other common aspects of an animation. 

The animation XML file belongs in the res/anim/ directory 
of your Android project. The file must have a single root 
element: this will be either a single <alpha>, <scale>, 
<translate>, <rotate>, interpolator element, or <set> element 
that holds groups of these elements (which may include 
another <set>). By default, all animation instructions 
are applied simultaneously. To make them occur sequentially, 
you must specify the startOffset attribute, as shown 
in the example.
