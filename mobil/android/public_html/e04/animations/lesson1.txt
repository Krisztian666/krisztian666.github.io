XmlPullParser

XML Pull Parser is an interface that defines parsing 
functionality provided in XMLPULL V1 API

There are two key methods: next() and nextToken(). 
While next() provides access to high level parsing events, 
nextToken() allows access to lower level tokens. 

The current event state of the parser can be determined by calling 
the getEventType() method. Initially, the parser is in 
the START_DOCUMENT state.

The method next() advances the parser to the next event. 
The int value returned from next determines the current 
parser state and is identical to the value returned from 
following calls to getEventType ().

Th following event types are seen by next()

START_TAG
    An XML start tag was read. 
TEXT
    Text content was read; the text content can be retrieved 
    using the getText() method. (when in validating mode next() 
    will not report ignorable whitespace, use nextToken() instead) 
END_TAG
    An end tag was read 
END_DOCUMENT
    No more events are available

Add a new button to the ImportActivity layout file,
wich calls the importFromXml method. It reads the todos.xml file 
from the assets folder, and imports the ToDos.
