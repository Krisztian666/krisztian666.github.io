AsyncTask

AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. 
This class allows to perform background operations and publish 
results on the UI thread without having to manipulate threads 
and/or handlers. AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class 
around Thread and Handler. It should ideally be used for short 
operations, a few seconds at the most.

Usage

AsyncTask must be subclassed to be used. The subclass will override at 
least one method (doInBackground(Params...)), and most often will 
override a second one (onPostExecute(Result).)

Once created, a task is executed very simply:

 new ImportToDoTask().execute(url1, url2, url3);
(used in the new ImportActivity)



HttpURLConnection

An URLConnection for HTTP (RFC 2616) used to send and receive 
data over the web. Data may be of any type and length. This class 
may be used to send and receive streaming data whose length is not 
known in advance. 


In the ToDo example we

- create Import menu item as learned.//{img:"scr-main-menu.png", speak:"Import"}

- create a new ImportActivity with Android Studio
  with a layout containing
  an EditText for the URL of the imported data, and 
  an Import button, which calls the importFromHttp method 
  of the ImportActivity

- importFromHttp method executes the ImportToDoTask

- ImportToDoTask downloads and imports the ToDo datas

- It uses the new HttpURLConnectionHandler

- Add ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission to manifest.

The example file (todos.txt) is in the package 
com.example.todo.datahandler.net.http
The format is the same as we in the FileHandler used:
