Update a Database

When you need to modify a subset of your database values, 
use the update() method.
see: updateToDo method.


Read Information

To read from a database, use the query() method, passing it your 
selection criteria and desired columns. The results of the query are 
returned to you in a Cursor object.
To look at a row in the cursor, use one of the Cursor move methods, 
which you must always call before you begin reading values. Generally, 
you should start by calling moveToFirst(), which places the 
"read position" on the first entry in the results. For each row, 
you can read a column's value by calling one of the Cursor get methods, 
such as getString() or getLong().
see: 
  getAllToDo and 
  getAllToDoArrayList which processes the returned Cursor.
  getToDo returns one ToDo.



In the example we 

- add id to ToDo.java with getter and setter methods,
- rewrite DataManager.java to use DbHandler.
- create a menu in MainActivity for each ToDo row, 
  which allows to modify and delete ToDos. 
  Handle, if the ToDo list is modified.
- extend ToDoAdapter.java
