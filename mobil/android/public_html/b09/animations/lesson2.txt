Accessing Resources

Once you provide a resource in your application, 
you can apply it by referencing its resource ID. 
All resource IDs are defined in your project's 
R class, which will be automatically generated.
It contains resource IDs for all the resources 
in your res/ directory.

e.g.:
R.drawable.todoicon

Layout files:
R.layout.activity_main

View:
R.id.date
R.id.nameTextView

And the menu items:
R.id.action_addnew
R.id.action_settings
