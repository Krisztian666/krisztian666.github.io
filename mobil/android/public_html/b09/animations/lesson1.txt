Menu

Android provides a standard XML format to define menu items. 
Instead of building a menu in your activity's code, you should 
define a menu and all its items in an XML menu resource. 
You can then inflate the menu resource (load it as a Menu object) 
in your activity or fragment.

To define the menu for the MainActivity, open the generated 
XML file menu_main.xml inside your project's res/menu/ directory.
