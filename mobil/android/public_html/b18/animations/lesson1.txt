Creating Own UI Widget

App Widgets are miniature application views that can 
be embedded in other applications (such as the Home screen) 
and receive periodic updates.


The Basics

To create an App Widget, you need the following:

- AppWidgetProviderInfo object
Describes the metadata for an App Widget, such as the 
App Widget's layout, update frequency, and the AppWidgetProvider 
class. This should be defined in XML.

- AppWidgetProvider class implementation
Defines the basic methods that allow you to programmatically 
interface with the App Widget, based on broadcast events. 
Through it, you will receive broadcasts when the App Widget is 
updated, enabled, disabled and deleted.

- View layout
Defines the initial layout for the App Widget, defined in XML.

- Additionally, you can implement an App Widget configuration Activity. 
This is an optional Activity that launches when the user adds 
your App Widget and allows him or her to modify App Widget 
settings at create-time.

Android studio can generate you the necessary files.
