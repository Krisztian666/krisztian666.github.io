Saving Key-Value Sets

If you have a relatively small collection of key-values 
that you'd like to save, you should use the SharedPreferences 
APIs. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing 
key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write 
them. Each SharedPreferences file is managed by the framework 
and can be private or shared.

You can create a new shared preference file or access an 
existing one by calling one of two methods:

getSharedPreferences() 
Use this if you need multiple shared preference files identified 
by name, which you specify with the first parameter. You can call 
this from any Context in your app.

getPreferences() 
Use this from an Activity if you need to use 
only one shared preference file for the activity. Because this 
retrieves a default shared preference file that belongs to the 
activity, you don't need to supply a name.


In the example we create a ConfigureActivity and save the settings
into SharedPreferences.
Let the user set the time format.
