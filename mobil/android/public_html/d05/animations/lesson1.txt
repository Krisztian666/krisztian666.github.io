Delete Information from a Database

To delete rows from a table, you need to provide selection criteria 
that identify the rows. The database API provides a mechanism for 
creating selection criteria that protects against SQL injection. 
The mechanism divides the selection specification into a selection 
clause and selection arguments. The clause defines the columns to 
look at, and also allows you to combine column tests. The arguments 
are values to test against that are bound into the clause. Because 
the result isn't handled the same as a regular SQL statement, 
it is immune to SQL injection.
see deleteToDo method.
