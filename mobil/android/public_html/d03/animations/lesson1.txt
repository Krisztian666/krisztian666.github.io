Content provider

Content providers manage access to a structured set of data. They 
encapsulate the data, and provide mechanisms for defining data 
security. Content providers are the standard interface that 
connects data in one process with code running in another process. 

 When you want to access data in a content provider, you use the 
ContentResolver object in your application's Context to communicate 
with the provider as a client. 

In class ContactsProvider the method getContacts reads the 
contacts data from phone book. The permission READ_CONTACTS
is needed.
