ViewPager

This lesson shows you how to do screen slides with a 
ViewPager provided by the support library. ViewPagers 
can animate screen slides automatically. 


Create the Views

Create layout files that you will later use for the content. 
The example uses 3 layouts for the AddNewActivity. 
view_pager_left.xml   - Left example page
view_pager_right.xml  - Right example page
activity_add_new_xml  - Use the existing layout in the middle

Create a layout that contains a ViewPager.

Create PagerAdapter
Add ToDoPagerAdapter.java

Set the pager in the Activity
AddNewActivity.java
