Service Starting after Boot Process


Starting a Service

You can start a service from an activity or other application 
component by passing an Intent (specifying the service to start) 
to startService(). The Android system calls the service's 
onStartCommand() method and passes it the Intent. 
(You should never call onStartCommand() directly.)

Create a Broadcast Receiver which is called when the boot process 
completed, and start the service.
