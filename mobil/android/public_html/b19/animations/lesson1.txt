ActionBar

The action bar is a window feature that identifies the user 
location, and provides user actions and navigation modes. 


The action bar is included in all activities that use the 
Theme.Holo theme (or one of its descendants), which is the 
default theme when either the targetSdkVersion or minSdkVersion 
attribute is set to "11" or higher.
