Running a Service in the Foreground

A foreground service is a service that's considered to be 
something the user is actively aware of and thus not a candidate 
for the system to kill when low on memory. A foreground service 
must provide a notification for the status bar, which is placed 
under the "Ongoing" heading, which means that the notification 
cannot be dismissed unless the service is either stopped or 
removed from the foreground.

To request that your service run in the foreground, call 
startForeground().
To remove the service from the foreground, call 
stopForeground(). 

Modify the ToDoServiceBound.
