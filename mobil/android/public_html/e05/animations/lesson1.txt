JSON

JSON, (JavaScript Object Notation), is an open standard format that 
uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting 
of attributeâ€“value pairs. (Wikipedia)


JsonReader
Reads a JSON (RFC 4627) encoded value as a stream of tokens.

Parsing JSON
To create a recursive descent parser for your own JSON streams, 
first create an entry point method that creates a JsonReader.

Next, create handler methods for each structure in your JSON text. 
You'll need a method for each object type and for each array type. 

see: ToDoJSONParser.java


Add a new button to the ImportActivity layout file,
wich calls the importFromJSON method. It reads the todos.json file 
from the assets folder, and imports the ToDos.
