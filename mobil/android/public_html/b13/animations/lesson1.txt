The basics of Material Design

Material design is a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, 
and interaction design across platforms and devices.

Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above includes support 
for material design apps. You can add many material design features 
to your app while maintaining compatibility with versions of 
Android earlier than 5.0.

To create apps with material design:

- Apply the material theme in your app, specify a style that 
inherits from android:Theme.Material 
To be compatible with devices running previous releases of Android, 
use two different theme.
1. Use a theme that inherits from an older theme in 
res/values/styles.xml
2. Define a theme with the same name that inherits from the 
material theme in res/values-v21/styles.xml.

- Customize View Shadows and Outlines
Define new background drawable in directory:
res/drawable/
in the example: outline_rectangle.xml

- To update an existing app to incorporate material design, 
update your layouts following material design guidelines. 
Also make sure to incorporate depth (elevation), touch feedback, 
and animations. Create your layout files for Android 5.0 (API level 21) 
inside res/layout-v21/ 
and keep your alternative layout files for earlier versions of Android 
inside res/layout/.
