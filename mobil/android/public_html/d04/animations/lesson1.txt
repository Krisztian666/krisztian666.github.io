Saving Data in SQL Databases

Saving data to a database is ideal for repeating or structured data.
The APIs you'll need to use a database on Android are available 
in the android.database.sqlite package.


Define a Schema and Contract

One of the main principles of SQL databases is the schema: 
a formal declaration of how the database is organized. 
The schema is reflected in the SQL statements that you use to 
create your database. You may find it helpful to create a companion 
class, known as a contract class, which explicitly specifies the 
layout of your schema in a systematic and self-documenting way.
A contract class is a container for constants that define names 
for URIs, tables, and columns.
